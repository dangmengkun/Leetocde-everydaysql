we should use union all instead of union because union all will keep all the records even the 'duplicated' one.
select ids as id, num_friends as num
from
(select ids,count(*) as num_friends
from(
select requester_id as ids from request_accepted
union all
select accepter_id from request_accepted
    ) as tb1
    group by ids) tb2
    order by num desc
    limit 1
